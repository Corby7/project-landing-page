He's just a pest that needs to be crushed once and for all.</div>

He's always getting in the way of my conquests, and I'm tired of dealing with his constant interference. He's just a second-rate Mario, and I will not rest until both of them are out of my way for good.</div>

He's just another obstacle that I will eliminate on my way to ultimate victory.
